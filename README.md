# GigaChat has been reborned.

The idea of a deployed system with a multi-module deployment was unpromising in the current plan of creation. I (MrSvinia) made the difficult decision to completely restart the project. Due to internal disagreements, and the withdrawal of most of the developers from the project, the full right of orders passed to me. I changed the course of development to a more monolithic structure, and a strict documentation policy. All outdated repositories are archived in order to preserve the history.
